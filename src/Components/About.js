        When I am not coding, I enjoy exploring the latest tech trends and
        participating in hackathons and coding competitions. Let's connect and
        create something amazing together! Whether it's building a new app,
        diving into a complex algorithm, or simply exchanging knowledge, I am
        excited to engage with like-minded individuals and contribute to the
        tech community.
