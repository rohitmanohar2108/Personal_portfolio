        I am a Computer Science Student at NITK. I have a deep passion for
        coding and constantly strive to enhance my skills by learning new
        technologies. I love tackling challenging problems and finding
        innovative solutions. My areas of interest include web development,
        programming, and many more. I am always eager to collaborate on
        exciting projects and learn from others in the field. When I am not
        coding, I enjoy exploring the latest tech trends and participating
        in hackathons and coding competitions. Let's connect and create
        something amazing together! Whether it's building a new app, diving
        into a complex algorithm, or simply exchanging knowledge, I am
        excited to engage with like-minded individuals and contribute to the
        tech community.
